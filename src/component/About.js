                <p className="lead">Students are the future leaders of a nation. The prosperity of a nation depends on its students. We have a responsibility to acquire proper education, maintain good character and live a respectable social life. Obedience, diligence, regularity and forbearance are the important parts of student life. We must learn perseverance; it is the root of all success. If we are idle and cannot move on according to time, we can achieve nothing.

                    The most important factor that affects the student life is the value of time.</p>
                <p className="lead">Being a student we should do everything on time as it never waits for anyone. Obeying one’s parents and teachers and respecting and loving one’s elders are the great virtues of a student. Another important part of a student’s life is his/her social life. A student must have good discipline and he/she must be co-operative with everyone. Social life influences our character in many ways.

                    Many students enter college expecting good times, friendship and a good sense of direction. They soon find out that colleges come with challenges and struggles because of the great demands and expectations that are put on the importance of education. Students experience a great deal of stress many times. Thus, it is very important for them to manage a proper routine and stick to it.
